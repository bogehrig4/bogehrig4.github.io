<h1>Bagels Program</h1>
<p>The Bagels Program is similar to the game Wordle. A user must guess a random three digit number using clues from their previous guesses. For each number the user inputs, the program will either output the word Bagels, Pico, or Fermi. Bagels means the digit isn't in the number. Pico means the digit is in the number, but isn't in the correct place. Fermi means the digit is in the number and in the right place.</p>
