<h1>NetLogo Simulations</h1>
<p>NetLogo simulations demonstrate real-world situations based on certain factors. I used the wolf-sheeep-grass simulation and the virus simulation.</p>
<p>What I learned from the sheep wolf simulation is that the if the sheep-gain-from-food increases, the amount of sheep will drastically increase, which then allows the wolf population to increase. Because of this, the sheep all die off, and then so do the wolves because of lack of food. So, in short, all animals will die if there is an overpopulation of sheep. Also, what I learned is that if the reproduce percentage is increased for either animal, that animal is more likely to die faster than at a lower reproduction rate. This is most likely because there is not enough food to support the entire population. If the grass regrowth rate increases, the sheep will be more likely to stay alive because they will be better supplied with food</p>
<p>What I learned about the virus simulation is that when the infectiousness is a high percentage and the chance of recovery is a low percentage, after a few years there are no infected people anymore. I'm assuming this is because a most people who had the virus will die off, and the few percentage who didn't get sick will survive and repopulate. What I also learned is that when infectiousness and chance of recovery are both even, there is a continuous cycle of a sickness. In other words, there are waves of highly infected populations and waves of many immune people. Also, the more people, the more likely it is for people to receive the virus.</p>
