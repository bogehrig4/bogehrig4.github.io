<h1>Combo Menu Program</h1>
<p>Purpose:
The combo menu project is used to order a meal (burger, fries, drink). The user is told the price of the items, orders the type of burger they want, as well as the size of their beverage and fries if they want them. The user also orders the amount of ketchup packets they want for their burger. If they order all items in the meal, they get a one dollar discount. The total cost of their order is then added up and given to the user. This applies to real life because if someone wants to order lunch or dinner for themselves, they can use this.</p>
